Here is an overview of the upcoming features

+ Add shipping address on checkout
+ Payment options
+ Order status
+ Order tracking
+ Order cancellation
+ Product review

## Installation

If you want to checkout the code and install it on your local machine you may clone my repo by simply running this command.

### `git clone git@gitlab.com:batch-211-bautista/capstone-2-bautista.git`

Then install the packages by simply running.

### `npm install`

Then simply run this command to start it on your localhost.

### `nodemon index.js`

Please feel free to use your favorite API Testing tool but I recommend using Postman.

## Roadmap

For the future releases, I'm planning to follow the list of my upcoming new features listed above and I will also update this README file once I got new ideas along the way.

## <a name="#project-status"></a>Project Status

As of now, I'm taking a break on development since I am also going to be busy on Job hunting. But please feel free to check the code and let me know if you find any bugs or potential new features.
